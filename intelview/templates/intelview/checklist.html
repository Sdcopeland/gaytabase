				<div class="checkitem">During the residency, students will be in class from 9am-5pm, Monday through Friday, and on no more than one Saturday per month. Evenings and open weekends are free - as long as you are back in the training room on time the next day.

				<div class="checkitem">Code for Progress will give students a stipend to pay for housing and live in DC during the residency in DC. We will also help you to find housing for those four months, if you don't already live in the area. Paying for other things is up to you.

				<div class="checkitem">After the residency, we'll have a group phone call or online community activity every week until April 1, 2014. This will take no more than half an hour each week, but it really is required (because what we do in those activities is a big part of what makes our program different).

				<div class="checkitem">Code for Progress is a training, but it's also a community. That means we expect our graduates to mentor new students, and to come back and teach every now and then (we'll give you the things you need to do that).
